# SDL_BGI Legacy BGI Clock  
  
This is a copy of a leagcy DOS BGI Clock example.  
It is using the SDL_Bgi graphics.h for the conversion to run on a modern PC.  

It makes use of the BGI Graphics driver wich is meant to keep compatability with the old BGI DOS driver. This tends to make the graphics feel a bit slow and glitchy but other methods of implimenting SDL_Bgi can correct this.  

It is just a copy of the base code as a comparison to other SDL_Bgi clock version that I have created.

You will need [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) development version, [SDL_Bgi V3](https://sdl-bgi.sourceforge.io/) as wel as [WavBeep02.zip](https://encode.su/threads/383-A-command-line-tool-for-Windows-which-beeps-through-the-System-Speaker).  
Please read my booklet ["A Beginners Guide To SDL_bgi.pdf"](https://github.com/Axle-Ozz-i-sofT/A-BEGINNERS-GUIDE-TO-PROGRAMMING/tree/main/Supplimental/A%20Beginners_Guide_To_SDL_bgi) for how to set up the library as well as setting up the project in Dev-C++ and Code::Blocks.

At the moment I have only done some C language demos but I am looking at creating some SDL_Bgi demos in both FreeBASIC and Python3 as well.
